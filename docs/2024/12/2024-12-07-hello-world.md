# Hello World

Inspired by the work of Krzysztof Jendrzyca (from his [blog](https://krzysztof.io) and the [Skuteczny Programista](https://skutecznyprogramista.pl) portal), I've decided to create my own online space where I'll "learn out loud" and "document my journey" in the IT field. My goal is to effectively absorb and organize the knowledge I'm currently exploring.

My posts will be more like a knowledge base (wiki) than traditional articles, focusing primarily on C++ and programming in general. I’ll also share notes from interesting books and articles I’ve read, as well as tools I use daily in my work as a programmer.
