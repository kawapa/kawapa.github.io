# Rapid Planning Method

Achieving your chosen goal depends on several factors: how clearly and specifically you define what you want, and whether you're motivated enough **to pursue the goal—especially when things don't go as planned**. This post highlights key points from Anthony Robbins' lecture on goal planning.

## What do I really want?

> - What do I want?<br>
> - What's my outcome?<br>
> - What's my result?

- A goal is not an activity!
- A goal must be specific.
- **Focusing on the goal (not the plan to achieve it) is key to maintaining motivation.**

> Before you do anything (before starting your workday, before making a phone call, or before a meeting), ask yourself: **"What is my goal? What do I want to achieve through this?"**.

## Why do I want this?

> **Why must I do this, not just should I?**

- The reason for doing something is more important than the goal itself. Bad examples:
  - I want to make a million dollars – that’s a goal, not a reason.
  - I want to feed 3,000 homeless people in my city – that’s a reason, but it **doesn’t evoke the emotions needed to fuel you during tough moments and times of doubt.**
- 80% of success is your WHY, 20% is your HOW.
  - Having a "big enough" WHY will surely lead you to discover your HOW.
  - **Knowing your goal and understanding your WHY will help you find many paths to achieving your goal.**
- Find a strong enough reason to do something, and you will find a way to do it.

## How will I do it?

- There are many paths leading to the same goal (some less conventional than others).
- Brainstorm and write down all the ideas that come to mind.
  - Analyze these ideas and narrow them down to about 20%.

## What's next?

Once you learn to think this way, you won’t need any task management system.
